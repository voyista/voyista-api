 * `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
 * Ensure you're running Node (`v8.9.4`+) and NPM (`5.6.0`+)
 
 ## Developing
 
 After you have installed all dependencies you can now start developing with:

###### Deploy powered by [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) & [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
